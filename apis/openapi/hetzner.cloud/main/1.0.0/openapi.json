    "description": "This is the official documentation for the Hetzner Cloud API.\n\n ## Introduction\n\nThe Hetzner Cloud API operates over HTTPS and uses JSON as its data format. The API is a RESTful API and utilizes HTTP methods and HTTP status codes to specify requests and responses.\n\nAs an alternative to working directly with our API you may also consider to use:\n\n- Our CLI program [hcloud](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)\n - Our [library for Go](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-go)\n- Our [library for Python](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python)\n\nAlso you can find a [list of libraries, tools, and integrations on GitHub](https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud).\n \nIf you are developing integrations based on our API and your product is Open Source you may be eligible for a free one time \u20ac 50 / $ 50 (excl. VAT) credit on your account. Please contact us via the support page on your Cloud Console and let us know the following:\n\n- The type of integration you would like to develop\n- Link to the GitHub repo you will use for the Project\n- Link to some other Open Source work you have already done (if you have done so)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo get started using the API you first need an API token. Sign in into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security` \u2192 `API Tokens`, and generate a new token. Make sure to copy the token because it won\u2019t be shown to you again. A token is bound to a Project, to interact with the API of another Project you have to create a new token inside the Project. Let\u2019s say your new token is `LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj`.\n \nYou\u2019re now ready to do your first request against the API. To get a list of all Servers in your Project, issue the example request on the right side using [curl](https://curl.se/).\n\nMake sure to replace the token in the example command with the token you have just created. Since your Project probably does not contain any Servers yet, the example response will look like the response on the right side. We will almost always provide a resource root like `servers` inside the example response. A response can also contain a `meta` object with information like [Pagination](#pagination).\n\n**Example Request**\n\n```shell\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj\" \\\n  https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers\n```\n\n**Example Response**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"servers\": [],\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"pagination\": {\n      \"page\": 1,\n      \"per_page\": 25,\n      \"previous_page\": null,\n      \"next_page\": null,\n      \"last_page\": 1,\n      \"total_entries\": 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Authentication\n\nAll requests to the Hetzner Cloud API must be authenticated via a API token. Include your secret API token in every request you send to the API with the `Authorization` HTTP header.\n\nTo create a new API token for your Project, switch into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security` \u2192 `API Tokens`, and generate a new token.\n \n**Example Authorization header**\n\n```http\nAuthorization: Bearer LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj\n ```\n\n## Errors\n\nErrors are indicated by HTTP status codes. Further, the response of the request which generated the error contains an error code, an error message, and, optionally, error details. The schema of the error details object depends on the error code.\n\nThe error response contains the following keys:\n\n| Keys      | Meaning                                                               |\n| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `code`    | Short string indicating the type of error (machine-parsable)          |\n| `message` | Textual description on what has gone wrong                            |\n| `details` | An object providing for details on the error (schema depends on code) |\n\n**Example response**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"invalid_input\",\n    \"message\": \"invalid input in field 'broken_field': is too long\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"broken_field\",\n          \"messages\": [\"is too long\"]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Error Codes\n\n| Code                      | Description                                                                      |\n| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `forbidden`               | Insufficient permissions for this request                                        |\n| `unauthorized`            | Request was made with an invalid or unknown token                                |\n| `invalid_input`           | Error while parsing or processing the input                                      |\n| `json_error`              | Invalid JSON input in your request                                               |\n| `locked`                  | The item you are trying to access is locked (there is already an Action running) |\n| `not_found`               | Entity not found                                                                 |\n| `rate_limit_exceeded`     | Error when sending too many requests                                             |\n| `resource_limit_exceeded` | Error when exceeding the maximum quantity of a resource for an account           |\n| `resource_unavailable`    | The requested resource is currently unavailable (e.g. not available for order)   |\n| `server_error`            | Error within the API backend                                                     |\n| `service_error`           | Error within a service                                                           |\n | `uniqueness_error`        | One or more of the objects fields must be unique                                 |\n| `protected`               | The Action you are trying to start is protected for this resource                |\n| `maintenance`             | Cannot perform operation due to maintenance                                      |\n| `conflict`                | The resource has changed during the request, please retry                        |\n| `unsupported_error`       | The corresponding resource does not support the Action                           |\n| `token_readonly`          | The token is only allowed to perform GET requests                                |\n| `unavailable`             | A service or product is currently not available                                  |\n| `deprecated_api_endpoint` | The request can not be answered because the API functionality was removed        |\n\n**invalid_input**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"invalid_input\",\n    \"message\": \"invalid input in field 'broken_field': is too long\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"fields\" : [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"broken_field\",\n          \"messages\" : [\"is too long\"]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**uniqueness_error**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"uniqueness_error\",\n    \"message\": \"SSH key with the same fingerprint already exists\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"fields\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"public_key\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**resource_limit_exceeded**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"resource_limit_exceeded\",\n    \"message\": \"project limit exceeded\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"limits\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"project_limit\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**deprecated_api_endpoint**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"deprecated_api_endpoint\",\n    \"message\": \"API functionality was removed\",\n    \"details\": {\n      \"announcement\": \"https://docs.hetzner.cloud/changelog#2023-07-20-foo-endpoint-is-deprecated\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Labels\n\nLabels are `key/value` pairs that can be attached to all resources.\n\nValid label keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated by a slash (`/`). The name segment is required and must be a string of 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (`.`), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (`/`).\n\nValid label values must be a string of 63 characters or less and must be empty or begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between.\n\nThe `hetzner.cloud/` prefix is reserved and cannot be used.\n\n**Example Labels**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"labels\": {\n    \"environment\": \"development\",\n    \"service\": \"backend\",\n    \"example.com/my\": \"label\",\n    \"just-a-key\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Label Selector\n\nFor resources with labels, you can filter resources by their labels using the label selector query language.\n\n| Expression           | Meaning                                              |\n| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| `k==v` / `k=v`       | Value of key `k` does equal value `v`                |\n| `k!=v`               | Value of key `k` does not equal value `v`            |\n| `k`                  | Key `k` is present                                   |\n| `!k`                 | Key `k` is not present                               |\n| `k in (v1,v2,v3)`    | Value of key `k` is `v1`, `v2`, or `v3`              |\n| `k notin (v1,v2,v3)` | Value of key `k` is neither `v1`, nor `v2`, nor `v3` |\n| `k1==v,!k2`          | Value of key `k1` is `v` and key `k2` is not present |\n\n### Examples\n\n- Returns all resources that have a `env=production` label and that don't have a `type=database` label:\n\n  `env=production,type!=database`\n \n- Returns all resources that have a `env=testing` or `env=staging` label:\n\n  `env in (testing,staging)`\n\n- Returns all resources that don't have a `type` label:\n\n  `!type`\n\n## Pagination\n\nResponses which return multiple items support pagination. If they do support pagination, it can be controlled with following query string parameters:\n\n- A `page` parameter specifies the page to fetch. The number of the first page is 1.\n- A `per_page` parameter specifies the number of items returned per page. The default value is 25, the maximum value is 50 except otherwise specified in the documentation.\n\nResponses contain a `Link` header with pagination information.\n\nAdditionally, if the response body is JSON and the root object is an object, that object has a `pagination` object inside the `meta` object with pagination information:\n\n**Example Pagination**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"servers\": [...],\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"pagination\": {\n            \"page\": 2,\n            \"per_page\": 25,\n            \"previous_page\": 1,\n            \"next_page\": 3,\n            \"last_page\": 4,\n            \"total_entries\": 100\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe keys `previous_page`, `next_page`, `last_page`, and `total_entries` may be `null` when on the first page, last page, or when the total number of entries is unknown.\n\n**Example Pagination Link header**\n\n```http\nLink: <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=2&per_page=5>; rel=\"prev\",\n      <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=4&per_page=5>; rel=\"next\",\n      <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=6&per_page=5>; rel=\"last\"\n```\n\nLine breaks have been added for display purposes only and responses may only contain some of the above `rel` values.\n\n## Rate Limiting\n \nAll requests, whether they are authenticated or not, are subject to rate limiting. If you have reached your limit, your requests will be handled with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Burst requests are allowed. Responses contain serveral headers which provide information about your current rate limit status.\n\n- The `RateLimit-Limit` header contains the total number of requests you can perform per hour.\n- The `RateLimit-Remaining` header contains the number of requests remaining in the current rate limit time frame.\n- The `RateLimit-Reset` header contains a UNIX timestamp of the point in time when your rate limit will have recovered and you will have the full number of requests available again.\n\nThe default limit is 3600 requests per hour and per Project. The number of remaining requests increases gradually. For example, when your limit is 3600 requests per hour, the number of remaining requests will increase by 1 every second.\n\n## Server Metadata\n \nYour Server can discover metadata about itself by doing a HTTP request to specific URLs. The following data is available:\n\n| Data              | Format | Contents                                                     |\n| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| hostname          | text   | Name of the Server as set in the api                         |\n| instance-id       | number | ID of the server                                             |\n| public-ipv4       | text   | Primary public IPv4 address                                  |\n| private-networks  | yaml   | Details about the private networks the Server is attached to |\n| availability-zone | text   | Name of the availability zone that Server runs in            |\n| region            | text   | Network zone, e.g. eu-central                                |\n\n**Example: Summary**\n\n```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata\n ```\n\n```yaml\navailability-zone: hel1-dc2\nhostname: my-server\ninstance-id: 42\npublic-ipv4: 1.2.3.4\nregion: eu-central\n```\n\n**Example: Hostname**\n\n ```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/hostname\nmy-server\n ```\n\n**Example: Instance ID**\n\n```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/instance-id\n 42\n```\n\n**Example: Public IPv4**\n\n```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/public-ipv4\n 1.2.3.4\n```\n\n**Example: Private Networks**\n\n```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/private-networks\n ```\n\n```yaml\n- ip: 10.0.0.2\n  alias_ips: [10.0.0.3, 10.0.0.4]\n  interface_num: 1\n  mac_address: 86:00:00:2a:7d:e0\n  network_id: 1234\n  network_name: nw-test1\n  network: 10.0.0.0/8\n  subnet: 10.0.0.0/24\n  gateway: 10.0.0.1\n- ip: 192.168.0.2\n  alias_ips: []\n  interface_num: 2\n  mac_address: 86:00:00:2a:7d:e1\n  network_id: 4321\n  network_name: nw-test2\n  network: 192.168.0.0/16\n  subnet: 192.168.0.0/24\n  gateway: 192.168.0.1\n```\n\n**Example: Availability Zone**\n\n```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/availability-zone\nhel1-dc2\n ```\n\n**Example: Region**\n\n```shell\n$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/region\n eu-central\n```\n\n## Sorting\n\nSome responses which return multiple items support sorting. If they do support sorting the documentation states which fields can be used for sorting. You specify sorting with the `sort` query string parameter. You can sort by multiple fields. You can set the sort direction by appending `:asc` or `:desc` to the field name. By default, ascending sorting is used.\n\n**Example: Sorting**\n\n```\nhttps://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status\nhttps://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc\n https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:desc\nhttps://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc&sort=command:desc\n ```\n\n## Deprecation Notices\n\nYou can find all announced deprecations in our [Changelog](/changelog).\n",

IPs and network interfaces defined under Networks do not provide public internet connectivity, you will need to use the already existing public network interface for that.\n\nEach network has a user selected `ip_range` which defines all available IP addresses which can be used for Subnets within the Network.\n \nTo assign individual IPs to Servers you will need to create Network Subnets, described below.\n\nCurrently Networks support IPv4 only.\n\n### Subnets\n\nSubnets divide the `ip_range` from the parent Network object into multiple Subnetworks that you can use for different specific purposes.\n\nFor each subnet you need to specify its own `ip_range` which must be contained within the parent Network\u2019s `ip_range`. Additionally each subnet must belong to one of the available Network Zones described below. Subnets can not have overlapping IP ranges.\n\nCurrently there are three types of subnet:\n\n- type `cloud` is used to connect cloud Resources into your Network.\n- type `server` was used to connect only cloud Servers into your Network. This type is deprecated and is replaced by type cloud.\n- type `vswitch` allows you to connect [Dedicated Server vSwitch](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/network/vswitch) - and all Dedicated Servers attached to it - into your Network\n\nSubnets of type `vswitch` must set a `vswitch_id` which is the ID of the existing vSwitch in Hetzner Robot that should be coupled.\n\n### Network Zones\n\nNetwork Zones are groups of Locations which have special high-speed network connections between them. The [Location object](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#locations-get-a-location) contains the `network_zone` property each Location belongs to. Currently these network zones exist:\n\n| Network Zone | Contains Locations |\n| ------------ | ------------------ |\n| eu-central   | nbg1, fsn1, hel1   |\n| us-east      | ash                |\n| us-west      | hil                |\n| ap-southeast | sin                |\n\n### IP address management\n\nWhen a cloud Server is attached to a network without the user specifying an IP it automatically gets an IP address assigned from a subnet of type `server` in the same network zone. If you specify the optional `ip` parameter when attaching then we will try to assign that IP. Keep in mind that the Server\u2019s location must be covered by the Subnet\u2019s Network Zone if you specify an IP, or that at least one Subnet with the zone covering Server\u2019s location must exist.\n\nA cloud Server can also have more than one IP address in a Network by specifying aliases. For details see the [attach to network action](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#server-actions-attach-a-server-to-a-network).\n \nThe following IP addresses are reserved in networks and can not be used:\n\n - the first IP of the network `ip_range` as it will be used as a default gateway for the private Network interface.\n- `172.31.1.1` as it is being used as default gateway for our public Network interfaces.\n\n### Coupling Dedicated Servers\n \nBy using subnets of type `vswitch` you can couple the Cloud Networks with an existing [Dedicated Server vSwitch](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/network/vswitch) and enable dedicated and cloud servers to\ntalk to each other over the Network.\n In order for this to work the dedicated servers may only use IPs from the subnet and must have a special network configuration. Please refer to [FAQ](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/networks/connect-dedi-vswitch). vSwitch Layer 2 features are not supported.\n\n### Routes\n\nNetworks also support the notion of routes which are automatically applied to private traffic. A route makes sure that all packets for a given `destination` IP prefix will be sent to the address specified in its `gateway`.\n",

This Server then uses these IPs.\n\nYou can only unassign a Primary IP from a Server when it's powered off. This Primary IP can then be assigned to a different powered off Server, or you can keep it around for later use.\n\nPrimary IPs are bound to a specific Datacenter. You can not assign a Primary IP from one Datacenter to a Server in a different Datacenter. If you need this capability use Floating IPs instead.\n\nIf your Server's operating system supports cloud-init there is no further configuration needed to make Primary IPs work.\n\nPrimary IPs of type `ipv4` use a single IPv4 address as their `ip` property. Primary IPs of type `ipv6` use a /64 network such as `fc00::/64` as their `ip` property. Any IP address within that network can be used on your host.\n\nPrimary IPs are billed on an hourly basis.\n",

The netmask `/16` can be changed to a smaller one then `16` therefore increasing the IP range. A valid entry would be `10.0.0.0/15`, `10.0.0.0/14` or `10.0.0.0/13` and so on.\n\nIf a change is currently being performed on this [Network](#networks), a error response with code `conflict` will be returned.\n",

This is the recommended way. You can be even more specific by setting `datacenter` to the ID or name as listed in `/datacenters`. However we only recommend this if you want to assign a specific Primary IP to the Server which is located in the specified Datacenter.\n\nSome properties like `start_after_create` or `automount` will trigger Actions after the Server is created. Those Actions are listed in the `next_actions` field in the response.\n\nFor accessing your Server we strongly recommend to use SSH keys by passing the respective key IDs in `ssh_keys`. If you do not specify any `ssh_keys` we will generate a root password for you and return it in the response.\n\nPlease note that provided user-data is stored in our systems. While we take measures to protect it we highly recommend that you don\u2019t use it to store passwords or other sensitive information.\n\n #### Call specific error codes\n\n| Code                             | Description                                                |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n | `placement_error`                | An error during the placement occurred                     |\n| `primary_ip_assigned`            | The specified Primary IP is already assigned to a server   |\n| `primary_ip_datacenter_mismatch` | The specified Primary IP is in a different datacenter      |\n| `primary_ip_version_mismatch`    | The specified Primary IP has the wrong IP Version          |\n",

If the Server is currently running you must make sure that its disk content is consistent. Otherwise, the created Image may not be readable.\n\nTo make sure disk content is consistent, we recommend to shut down the Server prior to creating an Image.\n\nYou can either create a `backup` Image that is bound to the Server and therefore will be deleted when the Server is deleted, or you can create a `snapshot` Image which is completely independent of the Server it was created from and will survive Server deletion. Backup Images are only available when the backup option is enabled for the Server. Snapshot Images are billed on a per GB basis.\n",
